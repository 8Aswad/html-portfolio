    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><em>"Aquarius mind. Godsent vision. Future in Motion."</em></p>

    <p>Name's <strong>Eheri Oghenejabor Godsent</strong>, an Aquarius born to stand out, not fit in. I move different, think bigger, and never settle for the ordinary. My vibe is all about vision, freedom, and creating my own lane.</p>

    <p>Aquarius energy means I'm wired for originality - ideas, style, and ambition that can't be boxed in. I live to turn dreams into real moves and inspire others to do the same.</p>
